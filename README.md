# A Multi-Faceted Deep Learning Framework for Enhanced Cervical Cancer Diagnosis and Prognosis

This repo contains code and technical report designated for a binary classifier on Cervical Cancer WIF's. Multiple strategies where tested, reports have been generated for such ideas and our proposed model was developed for the challange.

Our approach contains two distinct models. One Lightweight Multi-Resolution and Multi-Task model that has an accuracy of %92 while maintaining the ability to perform segmentation, the other model utilizes Ensemble-Stacking and Grad-CAM, achieving an accuracy of ~99% on SIPaKMeD Dataset, and a ~90% on Herlev dataset.
